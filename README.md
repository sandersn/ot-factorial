# Factorial Typologies in Optimality Theory

Includes

1. The tex source to build my qualifying paper.
2. Python and Haskell source for various stages of the implementation.

I believe Factorial.hs is the closest to the final version and count_factorial.py is the oldest.
RVolume.hs is missing my contribution (labelled, at least), and has some different
names and less-related things still in.

I guess 2006 is when I switched from Python to Haskell!
